# Pokemon Mini-Project

This is my own one-page interactive frontend application that showcases Pokémon data from a **public API (PokéAPI)**.  
I created this project for **TUMO Labs** as part of the Short Stack station projects.  
I also added a bonus feature: a **Favorites Collection**, allowing users to save their favorite Pokémon and view their details.

## Features
- Fetch and display a list of 20 Pokémon.
- Click on a Pokémon to see detailed information:
  - Height
  - Weight
  - Types
  - Image
- **Favorites Collection**:
  - Add or remove Pokémon from favorites.
  - View all favorite Pokémon.
  - Click a favorite to see its details.
- No persistent storage (favorites are reset on page refresh).

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on a Pokémon in the main list to see its details.
3. Click "Add to Favorites" to save a Pokémon.
4. Click a Pokémon in the Favorites Collection to view its details.
5. Click "Remove from Favorites" to remove it from your collection.
